_Tool to manage incomes and outcomes following the accrual principle_

> **Accrual** is an economic/accounting principle that states that transactions or economic events are recorded when they occur or when there is a firm commitment for them to happen, irrespective of the date of payment or collection, i.e., it is a right that is earned but not collected.

This means that if a student enrolls in a 16-week program and pays today, but the cohort starts in two months, the economic event (not the payment) must start in two months and be distributed over the four months of the course, depending on the number of classes.

For example:
-----------
- Student:
  - Enrollment: Mar 4th
  - First payment: 50% on Mar 4th
  - Last payment: 50% on May 26th
- Course:
  - Cost: 500 â‚¬
  - Start: May 12th
  - Ends: August 27th
  - Classes per week: 2 (Mon, Wed) -> 32 classes per course

As the months have a different number of classes depending on their weeks, the distribution of the course price would be:
|  Month  |  Classes  |  Percentage  |  Accrued amount  |
|---------|-----------|--------------|------------------|
|  May    |     6     |    18,75     |      93,75       |
|  June   |     9     |    28,125    |     140,625      |
|  July   |     9     |    28,125    |     140,625      |
|  August |     8     |    25,00     |     125,00       |
